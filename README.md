#PACMAN Trainer
Become a pro at PacMan

###What is this?
The Pacman Trainer is a tool that helps you play Pacman. This tool visualizes the ghost's real target *(surprise, it's not Pacman directly!)* as well as provides a few other tips such as dots remaining, cruise-elroy mode and seconds remaining in power mode.

###How to use
This tool runs on the NES Emulator called [FCEUX](http://www.fceux.com/web/home.html). The emulator is for Windows only, however you can compile it for Mac/Linux or run it under Wine. *(Wine is a tool to run Windows EXE files on Mac/Linux. I run it on my Mac this way).*

Run the emulator, open the ROM. Click File -> Lua -> New Lua Script Window -> Browse -> Then Click Run.

You will now see overlays on the game

#####What is this showing me?
These overlays shows many things. How many dots are left, if the red ghost is in "Cruise Elroy Mode" (faster mode) and most importantly, the ghost's targeting tile. The ghosts movements are not random. They target a tile and go for that. Understanding these concepts will help you play better.

#####Why is there only one file?
I cannot redistribute the emulator and cannot legally distribute the ROM (the game rip) of PacMan. You can easily find this 'ROM' by performing a search. Be sure that you own the game before you do this. [eBay](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=pacman+nes). "Pac-Man (USA) (Namco).nes"
